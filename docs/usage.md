# The `annotaitr` CLI

```bash
annotaitr [options] [target ...]
```

Prose introducing the shape: `annotaitr` is one binary for two review modes.
Which mode runs is auto-detected from `target`; every flag below is
mode-specific except `--help`, `--origin` and `--as`.

## Mode detection

| Target | Mode |
|--------|------|
| No target, on macOS with an image on the clipboard | Image (clipboard) |
| No target, otherwise | Prints help and exits `0` |
| One or more existing files, all markdown/plain-text | Markdown |
| A single `http(s)` URL | Image (capture) |
| A single existing file with a supported image extension (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`) | Image (local file) |
| Anything else | Exits `1` naming the supported extensions and suggesting `--as` |

```bash
annotaitr README.md docs/guide.md    # markdown: multiple files, tab bar
annotaitr ./mockup.png               # image: local file
annotaitr http://localhost:3000      # image: capture
annotaitr                            # image: clipboard (macOS), or help
annotaitr --as image ./diagram.svg   # skip detection, force a mode
```

## `--as`

Forces `image` or `markdown`, skipping detection entirely. Use it when a
target's extension doesn't say what it is: an `.svg` diagram meant for image
review, for instance.

```bash
annotaitr --as image ./diagram.svg
```

## `--origin`

Identifies the caller in the feedback output and to the client's origin
badge. One of `cli` (default), `claude-code`, `opencode`, `vibe`. Set
automatically by the Claude Code, OpenCode and Vibe integrations; a plain
terminal invocation never needs it.

## `--viewport`

Image mode only, and only meaningful when the target is a URL. A preset
(the default `desktop`, or `laptop`, `tablet`, `mobile`) or an explicit
`<width>x<height>`.

```bash
annotaitr --viewport mobile http://localhost:3000/checkout
annotaitr --viewport 1024x768 http://localhost:3000
```

## `--feedback-notes`

Markdown mode only. Attaches read-only AI notes to the first file, so a
re-opened review round shows what changed since the last submission instead
of a blank slate. A JSON array of `{text, line?}` objects, inline or as a
file path; `line` is the line number in the file being opened, omitted for a
general note.

```bash
annotaitr --feedback-notes '[{"text":"Rewrote intro","line":5}]' README.md
annotaitr --feedback-notes notes.json README.md
```

<details>
<summary>Same option via the ANNOTAITR_FEEDBACK_NOTES environment variable</summary>

```bash
ANNOTAITR_FEEDBACK_NOTES='[{"text":"Rewrote intro","line":5}]' annotaitr README.md
```

</details>

## Environment variables

| Variable | Applies to | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `ANNOTAITR_PORT` | both | Port or inclusive range (`3000` or `3000-3010`); the first free port wins |
| `ANNOTAITR_HOST` | both | Host to bind to (default `127.0.0.1`) |
| `ANNOTAITR_BROWSER` | both | Custom browser application |
| `ANNOTAITR_TIMEOUT` | both | Heartbeat timeout in ms (default `30000`, range `5000`-`300000`) |
| `ANNOTAITR_NO_OPEN` | both | Skip opening a browser tab automatically |
| `ANNOTAITR_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT` | image | Page-load timeout in ms for URL capture |
| `ANNOTAITR_FEEDBACK_NOTES` | markdown | Same as `--feedback-notes` |
| `PLANTUML_SERVER_URL` | markdown | PlantUML render server (default `https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml`) |
| `KROKI_SERVER_URL` | markdown | Kroki render server (default `https://kroki.io`) |

> [!NOTE]
> `MD_ANNOTATOR_*` still works as a deprecated fallback for the
> corresponding `ANNOTAITR_*` variable, with a one-time warning on stderr.
> See [Migration](migration.md).

<!-- -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When rendering PlantUML or Kroki diagrams, the diagram source is encoded
> and sent to the configured server: the public `plantuml.com` and
> `kroki.io` by default. Self-host a [PlantUML
> server](https://hub.docker.com/r/plantuml/plantuml-server) or [Kroki
> server](https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/) and set
> `PLANTUML_SERVER_URL` / `KROKI_SERVER_URL` if your diagrams are sensitive.

## Output and exit codes

The server starts on an available port and opens the browser; a status line
goes to stderr, the decision goes to stdout on exit:

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | Approved, or feedback submitted: stdout carries the formatted decision |
| `1` | An error (bad arguments, unsupported target), the browser tab was closed with no decision, or the process was interrupted (`Ctrl+C`) |

`md-annotator` works as an alias for the same binary, for existing scripts
and shell aliases.
